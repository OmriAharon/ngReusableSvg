{"name":"ngReusableSvg","tagline":"Creates a reusable SVG component out of an external SVG file.","body":"### What is this package ?\r\n\r\nI created this package since I wanted a way to work with external SVG files, and still be able to change its CSS and scale it as I wished, making the SVG reusable.\r\n\r\n### How to use it ?\r\n\r\nVery simple. \r\n\r\nAfter you've installed the package, add `ngReusableSvg` as a dependency to your module. Now simply use the 'oa-create-svg' directive on an `<object>` tag, and specify dimensions. Like this:\r\n\r\n    <object oa-create-svg\r\n                id=\"my-svg\"\r\n                data=\"my_icon.svg\"\r\n                type=\"image/svg+xml\"\r\n                class=\"svg-class\"\r\n                height=\"30\"\r\n                width=\"30\">\r\n    </object>\r\n\r\nYou can give the object its classes, id, and other attributes which will be placed into the `<div>` element that will replace the `<object>`.","google":"UA-65037011-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
